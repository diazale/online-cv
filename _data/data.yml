career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am a PhD candidate at McGill University's Quantitative Life Sciences
      program. My research interests are in high dimensional statistics in the
      world of genetics. My primary research is at the Gravel Lab studying
      population genetics and how to use dimension reduction to understand and
      improve inference on data. I am also interested in using data from
      single-cell RNA sequencing, neuroinformatics, and biological data in general
      in my role as a statistical mercenary. I also teach and lead workshops
      in computing and statistics.
education:
    - degree: PhD (Quantitative Life Sciences)
      university: McGill University
      time: 2017 - present
      details: |
       My research is in population genetics under the supervision of Dr.
