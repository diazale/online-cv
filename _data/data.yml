    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am a PhD candidate at McGill University's Quantitative Life Sciences
      program. My research interests are in high dimensional statistics in the
      world of genetics. My primary research is at Simon Gravel's lab studying
      population genetics and how to use dimension reduction to understand and
      improve inference on data. I am also interested in using data from
      single-cell RNA sequencing, neuroinformatics, and biological data in general
      in my role as a statistical mercenary. I also teach and lead workshops
      in computing and statistics.
education:
    - degree: PhD (Quantitative Life Sciences, in progress)
      university: McGill University
      time: 2017 - present
      details: |
       My research is in population genetics under the supervision of Dr.
       Simon Gravel. I focus on dimension reduction and high dimensional
       statistics, as well as developing methodologies to study problems in
       population genetics. I also supervise undergraduate students who carry
       out research under my direction as part of their course work or internships.
    - degree: MSc (Probability & Statistics)
      university: Carleton University
      time: 2012 - 2015
      details: |
        My thesis in data mining was supervised by Dr. Shirley Mills. I
        investigated approaches to inferring teammate chemistry as well as
        measurements of individual and team performance using National Hockey
        League data.
    - degree: BMath (Statistics, Pure Math)
      university: University of Waterloo
      time: 2005 - 2010
      details: |
        I completed my undergraduate in the Faculty of Mathematics at the
        University of Waterloo. My major was statistics and my minor was in
        pure mathematics, with additional courses in analysis, computer science,
        combinatorics, and number theory.
experiences:
    - role: Teaching assistant
      time: 2018 - 2019
      company: McGill University, Montreal
      details: |
        I led bootcamps teaching graduate students applications of MATLAB for
        image analysis and using Python to solve ODEs.
    - role: Instructor
      time: 2018
      company: McGill University, Montreal
      details: |
        I was the instructor for EPIB613: Introduction to Statistical Software
        for McGill graduate students in epidemiology. The course covered how
        to implement statistical approaches using R.
    - role: Mathematical statistician
      time: 2010 - 2017
      company: Statistics Canada, Ottawa
      details: |
        I was responsible for the development and implementation of statistical
        methods for several surveys and projects. My responsibilities included
        survey design, sample selection and allocation, weighting, estimation,
        statistical programming, record linkage, and writing and presenting 
        technical reports to stakeholders as well as supervision duties.
        My projects included:
          - The International Travel Survey
          - The Canadian Survey of Economic Well-Being
          - The Canadian Income Survey
          - The Longitudinal Immigration Database
    - role: Technical consultant
      time: 2007 - 2010
      company: The Co-operators, Guelph
      details: |
        I was responsible for developing internal applications for insurance
